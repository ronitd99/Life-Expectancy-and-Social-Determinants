This project explores the fundamental question of how economic and social development shape population health outcomes, using life expectancy at birth as the primary indicator. Life expectancy is a widely recognized proxy for overall well-being because it integrates the cumulative effects of healthcare systems, living conditions, education, and public policy. By combining World Bank datasets from 2000 through 2022, I investigated the relationships between life expectancy and four major predictors: GDP per capita, health spending per person, adult literacy rates, and total population size.

My results confirm that life expectancy is not determined solely by biology but is deeply linked to socioeconomic conditions. Correlation analysis revealed strong associations between life expectancy and GDP per capita (r = 0.59), health spending (r = 0.58), and literacy rates (r = 0.81). In contrast, population size displayed almost no relationship with longevity (r = –0.03), suggesting that the scale of a country’s population matters far less than how its resources are distributed and invested. Scatterplots reinforced these findings, showing steep gains in longevity at low to middle levels of GDP and health spending, but diminishing returns at higher levels. Literacy, however, exhibited a nearly linear effect across the full distribution.

Global trends over the study period show steady progress: average life expectancy rose by more than six years worldwide, while GDP per capita nearly doubled, health spending increased sharply, and literacy continued to climb. These results carry clear policy implications. For low- and middle-income countries, small improvements in income, healthcare investment, and educational access can generate disproportionately large health gains. For high-income countries, where returns on spending are flatter, attention must shift toward efficiency, equity, and addressing disparities.
